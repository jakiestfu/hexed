description: Organize code in a consistent and logical manner.
globs: */**
---
- This is a project using Next.js, TypeScript, React and a monorepo structure with Turborepo and pnpm workspaces.
- Structure files logically, grouping related components, helpers, types and static content.
- Prefer named exports for components over default exports.
- Favor small, single-purpose components over large, monolithic ones.
- Separate concerns between presentational and container components.
- Use `@binspace/*` as the namespace prefix in Turborepo.
- Structure the Turborepo into three main workspaces: apps, packages and tooling.
- Framework: Next.js App Router, TypeScript, React, Node.js
- UI: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS
- Key libraries: React Hook Form, Zod, Lucide React, NiceModal, Nuqs
- Database: Prisma ORM
- Monorepo: Turborepo with pnpm workspaces
- Namespace: `@binspace/*`
- Workspace Organization
```
/apps                   # Applications (executable)
  /web                  # Main web application

/packages               # Shared packages
  /binary-utils         # Hex tools
  /types                # Shared/common types
  /ui                   # Design system (shadcn/ui)
```

- Use kebab-case for file names: `add-item-form.tsx`
